# Advanced Weather Dashboard & Logbook

**Author:** Imene Boukhelkhal
**Date:** October 2025

This is a full-stack weather application built with Next.js that provides real-time weather data, forecasts, and a persistent logbook for saving and reviewing weather records for different locations and date ranges. The project demonstrates a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system, integration with multiple external APIs, and data export functionalities.

**Live Demo:** `[https://weather-app-jp88.vercel.app]`  


## ‚ú® Key Features

    * Get current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city in the world.
    * Autocomplete search suggestions for easy location finding.
    * "Use my location" feature for instant weather data based on geolocation.

* **Persistent Weather Logbook (CRUD):**
